## Description

This website sends dominos pizza to your house, but better.

## How It Works

1. The user is prompted to pick an option between regular order style and super duper cool order style.

2. If regular order style is chosen; then they put in their personal info, billing, and favorite pizza topings.

3. If the Super Duper Cool order style is chosen then the user is prompted to put their personal + billing info and then a random pizza is billed and built then sent to their house.

4. *possible addition of a thrid mode(weirdo mode) which makes a plain cheese pizza and sends that pizza to a random person in your zipcode(user pays)*
